# Pico Lights

For halloween and christmas I always setup some custom lights using some individually addressable LEDS. This year I decided to 
put it in a repository so I don't rewrite it every year. 

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (to control the light strips)
- WS2812B LED Strip (or similar)
- Raspberry Pi zero W (to control the Pico Ws over wifi)

## Software

- Pico C/C++ SDK
- Starter code from [WS2812](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio/ws2812), [wifi](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pico_w/wifi)
